Welcome to my Android developer blog! I bring over 35 years of experience in IT and Data Engineering, paired with a strong passion for experimentation. As a hobbyist, I'm currently exploring Android development, using modern low-code platforms and AI-powered tools to pursue a fresh creative direction. This endeavor allows me to try something new and expand my technical curiosity beyond traditional professional boundaries.

I intend to build apps that are both useful and enjoyable, designed to reflect my own interests while delivering smooth, modern user experiences. Each project is assisted by pushing limits of today's AI and low-code platforms. This will allow me to iterate rapidly, expand my technical skills, and see firsthand whether these generative and agentic AI tools are capable of living up to the hype.

My approach is simple:
- No ads
- No collection of data
- No unnecessary or invasive permissions
- Simple apps without unnecessary bloat
- Just software built with none of the B.S.

Whether it's a productivity tool or a passion project, I am focused on building software that is both useful and fun. The result of all of my projects will be released for free, and I hope they are enjoyed as much as I have had pleasure in creating them.

I hope to use this blog as a way to share what I have learned from working on these projects.
